# FiberOptic-Matlab
fiber optic communications simulation on matlab

Final project for the BAchelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering in Politecnico di Milano.

Matlab Simulation of a OOK transmission on a passive optical network. The simulation takes into account the impulse generation at the transmitter,
the attenuation in the fiber, the phase shift introduced, and the light recieving process through a photodiode and a TIA.

It is possible to see the difference between a standard transmission and a transmission where a section of phase-compensating fiber is introduced in the system.

Results are visualised through observation of the obtained EYE diagram and BER.
